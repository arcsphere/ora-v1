# 🌬️ ORA – Draw Your Moment

**Ora** is a minimalist, symbolic web app that transforms your freeform drawing into a daily ritual of reflection, sustainability, and awareness.

Through a single sketch and a moment of pause, Ora reveals a personalized set of insights — helping you breathe, reflect, and align with the world around you.

## ✨ What is Ora?

> “One breath. One shape. One shift.”  
> _Stay unconformtable to be at the edge of change._ — *Bhargavi, K2A Academy*

Ora means **hour** in Latin, **light** in Hebrew, and echoes **aura**, **now**, and **breath** across languages. It's a space to set your tone for the day and connect with sustainable values.
